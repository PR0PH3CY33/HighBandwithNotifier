# HighBandwithNotifier
A C program that passively monitors the machine's bandwidth usage and does something you specify if it exceeds a certain limit you also specify. 

I developed it for my server hosting my website so i get notified instantly if i get hit with a volumentric D(D)OS attack(s) its cumalitive attack bandwith is 20 Megabytes per second although it is configurable to any rate you see fit.
